1. Client posts log in to server

2. Server authenticates user and password

3. If authentication is success, server generates a token and sends it back 
to Client

4. Client saves the token in local storage

5. On future requests that require authentication, the client should always
pass token in the header to the server

6. Server verifies the token to make sure it's correct and not tampered with. 
If verified successfully then the server returns a response
